Security context:
	- Security context specify onbehafl of which user (of linux system) the container inside pod will be run
	- Default user is root with limit restriction, but we want to add more capabilities by setting securityContext
	- There're 2 levels of security context:
		- pod level: will affect all containers in pod

			apiVersion: v1
			kind: Pod
			metadata:
			  name: myapp-pod
			  labels:
			    app: myapp
			    type: mypod-type
			spec:
			  securityContext:
			    runAsUser: 1000
			  containers:
			  - name: mypod-container
			    image: xxx


		- container level

			apiVersion: v1
			kind: Pod
			metadata:
			  name: myapp-pod
			  labels:
			    app: myapp
			    type: mypod-type
			spec:
			  containers:
			  - name: mypod-container
			    image: xxx
			    securityContext:
			      runAsUser: 1000		# default not set => root
			      capabilities:
			        add: ["NET_ADMIN", "SYS_TIME"]


Notes:
	capabilities are only support at the container level!
