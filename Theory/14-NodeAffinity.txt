Node Affinity: allow us to limit pod placement on specific nodes with advanced options than NodeSelector


1. labels the node
	kubectl label nodes <node-name> <label-key>=<label-value>

	ex:
		kubectl label nodes node1 color=Blue
		kubectl describe node node1

2. Limit the pods only run on particular nodes with Affinity
	- Affinity Types:
		- requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
			- When creating pod: if scheduler cannot find node with matching rule defined in pod's affinity => the pod will not be scheduled

		- preferreddDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
			- When creating pod: if scheduler cannot find node with matching rule defined in pod's affinity => the pod will be scheduled on any available nodes

		NOTE: for both types: If the pod is running in matching node. But later, we change the node's labels, affinity rules not matching any more => pod still running on that node

- Template:
	apiVersion: v1
	kind: Pod
	metadata:
	  name: myapp-pod
	  labels:
	    app: myapp
	    type: mypod-type
	spec:
	  containers:
	  - name: mypod-container
	    image: xxx
	  
	  affinity:
	    nodeAffinity:
	      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
	        nodeSelectorTerms:
	        - matchExpressions:
	          - key: color
	            operator: In    # In, NotIn, Exists, ...
	            values:
	            - Blue



NOTE: In pratical, we ussualy combie Taint-Toleration with Node Affinity to force pods go to right nodes
