replicaset vs replication controller:
	- replicaset has property "selector"
	- replicaset is replacement for replication controller(old tech, doesnt have selector)
	- replicaset take care of matching pods (in selector), even if they were created before.
	- template:

		apiVersion: apps/v1
		kind: ReplicaSet
		metadata:
		  name: myapp-replicaset
		  labels:
		    app: myapp
		    type: myapp-type
		spec:
		  template:
		    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
		    \\POD TEMPLATE HERE\\
		    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
		  replicas: n
		  selector:
		    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
		    \\matchLabels - matchExpressions   -> math the pod   \\
		    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
		    matchLabels:
		      type: mypod-type // -> Match the labels of pod in template

basic commands:
	kubectl create -f my-replicaset.yml

	kubectl get replicaset
	kubectl describe replicaset myapp-replicaset
	kubectl delete replicaset myapp-replicaset

	Scale:
		kubectl replace -f my-replicaset.yml
		kubectl scale --replicas=6 -f xxx.yml
		kubectl scale replicaset myapp-replicaset --replicas=4
		kubectl edit replicaset myapp-replicaset
