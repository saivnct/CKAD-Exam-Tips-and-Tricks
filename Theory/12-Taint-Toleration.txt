-Taints And Tolerations:

- Placing a Taint on a node => prevent all pods from being placed on that node
	- template:
		kubectl taint nodes <node-name>	 <key=value>:<taint-effect>
	
	- taint-effect: what happens to PODs that DO NOT TOLERATE tained node
		- NoSchedule: pods will not 
		- PreferNoSchedule: scheduler try to avoid placing pods on the node, but that is not guaranteed
		- NoExecute: new pod will not be scheduled on the node, existing pods will be terminated

		ex:
		kubectl taint nodes node1 app=blue:NoSchedule


- Add Toleration to a pod => Allow pod to be placed on Tainted node
	- by default, pods have no toleration

	- template:
	
		apiVersion: v1
		kind: Pod
		metadata:
		  name: myapp-pod
		  labels:
		    app: myapp
		    type: mypod-type
		spec:
		  containers:
		  - name: mypod-container
		    image: xxx
		  
		  tolerations:    # must be same with tainted node
		  - key: "app"  
		    operator: "Equal"
		    value: "blue"
		    effect: "NoSchedule"

NOTE:
 - By default, the scheduler does not schedule any pods on the master node => When setup cluster, a tain is automatically placed on master node:
 	node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule


NOTE: In pratical, we ussualy combie Taint-Toleration with Node Affinity to force pods go to right nodes
